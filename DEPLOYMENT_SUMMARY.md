- `scripts/validate-server-actions.js` - Validates configuration
- `scripts/setup-railway.sh` - One-command Railway setup
- `scripts/railway-deploy.sh` - Deployment automation

#### ✅ Package.json Scripts

- `npm run validate:server-actions` - Validate configuration
- `npm run railway:build` - Build for Railway
- `npm run railway:start` - Start on Railway
- `npm run validate:railway` - Pre-deploy validation

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --follow

# Restart application
railway restart

# Update environment variables
railway variables set NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY="new-key"

# Run database migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Check health endpoint
curl $(railway domain)/api/health
```

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. "Failed to find Server Action" Error
```bash
# Generate new encryption key
npm run generate:server-key
# Copy the key and set it in Railway
railway variables set NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-key-here"
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set
railway variables | grep DATABASE_URL
# Run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### 3. Build Failures
```bash
# Check build locally
npm run railway:build
# Check environment validation
npm run validate:railway
```

# Report Date Field Migration

This document explains the migration of the `date` field in the `Report` table from a string to a DATE type.

## Background

Originally, the `date` field in the `Report` table was defined as a string (TEXT) type in the database. However, the Prisma schema defines it as a `DateTime` type with `@db.Date` modifier:

```prisma
model Report {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  date          DateTime @db.Date
  // other fields...
}
```

This discrepancy caused issues with queries, as Prisma expected a DateTime object but the database had string values.

## Migration Process

A migration script has been created to convert the `date` field from a string to a DATE type:

1. The migration creates a temporary column `date_new` of type DATE
2. It converts all existing string dates to DATE format and stores them in the temporary column
3. It makes the temporary column NOT NULL
4. It drops the original `date` column and renames `date_new` to `date`
5. It recreates the necessary indexes and constraints

## How to Apply the Migration

Run the following command to apply the migration:

```bash
./scripts/apply-date-migration.sh
```

This script will:

1. Apply the Prisma migration
2. Generate an updated Prisma client
3. Restart the development server to apply the changes

## Code Changes

After applying the migration, the API routes have been updated to handle dates correctly:

1. When querying the database, we pass date values as strings in ISO 8601 format
2. When creating or updating records, we also pass date values as strings
3. When receiving date values from the database, we handle them as Date objects

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with date handling after the migration:

1. Check the server logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all date values are being passed in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z)
3. Make sure the Prisma client has been regenerated after the migration
4. Restart the development server to ensure the latest schema is being used

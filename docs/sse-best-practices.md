# SSE Integration Best Practices

This document summarizes best practices for integrating Server-Sent Events (SSE) into your application, based on internal architecture and implementation plans.

---

## Overview

Server-Sent Events (SSE) enable one-way, real-time communication from server to client over HTTP. They are ideal for pushing notifications and updates without complex bidirectional protocols like WebSockets.

---

## Architecture

- Use an **SSE Handler singleton** to manage all client connections.
- Expose an **authenticated SSE API route** that:
  - Verifies user identity
  - Sets correct SSE headers
  - Registers clients with the handler
- Trigger SSE events from the **notification worker** to ensure real-time delivery.
- Use a **client-side hook** (`useSSE`) to manage EventSource lifecycle and event handling.

---

## Implementation Tips

- **Authenticate** all SSE connections to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Send an initial connection event** to confirm successful subscription.
- **Ping clients periodically** (e.g., every 30 seconds) to keep connections alive.
- **Handle disconnects gracefully** and clean up client references.
- **Batch notifications** or debounce high-frequency events to reduce load.
- Use **sticky sessions** or a **shared Redis pub/sub** for multi-instance deployments.
- Implement **connection limits per user** to avoid resource exhaustion.
- Use **exponential backoff** for client reconnection attempts.

---

## Performance & Scalability

- Monitor:
  - Total and per-user connection counts
  - Message delivery latency
  - Error rates
  - Resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Load test with high connection counts and message throughput.
- Consider **horizontal scaling** with shared state (e.g., Redis) for large deployments.

---

## Testing

- **Unit test** SSE handler methods and event emitters.
- **Integration test** end-to-end notification delivery.
- **Load test** under high concurrency and message rates.
- Test **reconnection scenarios** and error handling.

---

## Rollout Strategy

- **Phase 1:** Develop and test core SSE features.
- **Phase 2:** Limited production rollout with feature flags.
- **Phase 3:** Full rollout with monitoring.
- **Phase 4:** Optimize based on real-world data.

## Summary

Following these best practices will help ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable SSE integration that delivers real-time updates efficiently and securely.
